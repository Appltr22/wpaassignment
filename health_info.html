                <li><strong>Avoid Ultra-Processed Foods</strong>: Foods like snack cakes, fast food, and packaged cookies often contain unhealthy additives and are linked to obesity and other chronic conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Include Protein with Every Meal</strong>: This helps balance blood sugar levels and can support weight management and cardiovascular health.</li>
                <li><strong>Eat Oily Fish</strong>: Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, oily fish like salmon and mackerel are great for heart health and brain function.</li>
